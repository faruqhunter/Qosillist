# Qosillist
Qosil.List is a headless set of lists of components that can be used to build software applications. The primary purpose is to create a list of API's, components, data, logic and models that can be used in order to increase the integration and development of applications. The repository consolidates multiple list and provides a single API for all API's, components, data, logic and models so it can be ingested into development tools to provide faster development. The repository is free to use and we encourage the addition and feedback of other developers to increase the repository.
